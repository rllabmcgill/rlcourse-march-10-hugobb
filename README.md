# Automatic Discovery of Subgoals Using Diverse Density

This repository contains an implementation of [[1](#1)]

The code is tested on a two-room gridworld as in the paper. Only the subgoal discovery is implemented, the policy learning over the option hasn't been implemented.

Open notebook for explanation, and results.
